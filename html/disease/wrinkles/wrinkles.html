                    High blood pressure is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood
                     against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems,
                      such as heart disease.


                      High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when your blood pressure increases to unhealthy levels.
                       Your blood pressure measurement takes into account how much blood is
                        passing through your blood vessels and the amount of resistance the blood meets while the heart
                         is pumping.

                            Narrow arteries increase resistance. The narrower your arteries are,
                             the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, increased pressure
                              can cause health issues, including heart disease.




                    High blood pressure or hypertension increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. 
                    Hypertension risk factors include obesity, drinking too much alcohol, smoking, 
                    and family history. Beta-blockers are a common treatment for hypertension.

					Diagnosis
				  
				</h2>
				<p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Diagnosing hypertension is as simple as taking a blood pressure reading.
                     Most doctors’ offices check blood pressure as part of a routine visit.
                      If you don’t receive a blood pressure reading at your next appointment, request one.
                    </p>

                      <p class="sub-paragraph">
                        If your blood pressure is elevated, 
                        your doctor may request you have more readings over the course of a few days or weeks.
                        A hypertension diagnosis is rarely given after just one reading. Your doctor needs to 
                        see evidence of a sustained problem. That’s because your environment can contribute
                         to increased blood pressure, such as the stress you may feel by being at the doctor’s office.
                          Also, blood pressure levels change throughout the day.
                </p>
                
                <p class="sub-paragraph">If your blood pressure remains high, your doctor will likely conduct more tests
                                             to rule out underlying conditions. These tests can include:</p>
				<ul class="sub-list">
					<li>urine test</li>
					<li>cholesterol screening and other blood tests</li>
					<li>test of your heart’s electrical activity
                         with an electrocardiogram (EKG, sometimes referred to as an ECG)</li>

						Risk factors
					</h2>

					<p class="sub-paragraph">
								   
						High blood pressure has many risk factors, including:
					</p>
					<ul class="sub-list">
						<li><strong>Age.</strong> The risk of high blood pressure increases as you age.
                            Until about age 64,
                             high blood pressure is more common in men. 
                            Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after age 65.</li>
                        
                            
                            <li><strong>Race.</strong>  High blood pressure is particularly common 
                                among people of African heritage, often developing at an earlier age than 
                                it does in whites. Serious complications, such as stroke, heart attack and 
                                kidney failure, also are more common in people of African heritage.</li>
      
                                
                                <li><strong>Family history.</strong> High blood pressure tends to run in families.</li>
      
                                    

                                    <li><strong> Being overweight or obese.</strong> Being overweight or obese. The more you weigh the more
                                         blood you need to supply oxygen and nutrients to your tissues. As the volume 
                                         of blood circulated through your blood vessels increases, so does the pressure 
                                         on your artery walls..</li>
      
                                        
                                        <li><strong> Not being physically active.</strong> People who are inactive tend to have higher heart rates. The higher your heart rate, the harder your heart must work with each contraction and the stronger the force on your arteries. Lack of physical activity also increases the risk of being overweight.</li>
                                        


                                            <li><strong>Stress.</strong> High levels of stress can lead to a temporary increase in blood pressure. If you try to relax by eating more, using tobacco or drinking alcohol, you may only increase problems with high blood pressure.</li>
                                            


                                                <li><strong> Using tobacco.</strong> Using tobacco. Not only does smoking or chewing tobacco immediately raise your blood pressure temporarily, but the chemicals in tobacco can damage the lining of your artery walls. This can cause your arteries to narrow and increase your risk of heart disease. Secondhand smoke also can increase your heart disease risk</li>
                                                


                                                    <li><strong>Too little potassium in your diet.</strong> Potassium helps balance the amount of sodium in your cells. If you don't get enough potassium in your diet or retain enough potassium, you may accumulate too much sodium in your blood.</li>
                                                    

                                                        <li><strong>Too much salt (sodium) in your diet.</strong>  Too much sodium in your diet can cause your body to retain fluid, which increases blood pressure.</li>

							Women with hypertension can deliver healthy babies despite having the condition. But it can be dangerous to both mother and baby if it’s not monitored closely and managed during the pregnancy.

                            Women with high blood pressure are more likely to develop complications. For example, pregnant women with hypertension may experience decreased kidney function. Babies born to mothers with hypertension may have a low birth weight or be born prematurely.

                            Some women may develop hypertension during their pregnancies. Several types of high blood pressure problems can develop. The condition often reverses itself once the baby is born. Developing hypertension during pregnancy may increase your risk for developing hypertension later in life.
