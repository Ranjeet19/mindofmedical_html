                    The common cold is a viral infectious disease that infects the upper respiratory system. It is also known as acute viral rhinopharyngitis and acute coryza.

                    It is the most common infectious disease in humans and is mainly caused by coronaviruses or rhinoviruses.

                            The common cold can be caused by more than 200 different viruses.
                             Around 50 percent of colds are caused by rhinoviruses, other cold-causing viruses include:

                            When a virus manages to overpower the body’s immune system, infection occurs.
                             The first line of defense is mucus, which is produced in 
                             the nose and throat by the mucus glands. This mucus traps anything inhaled, such as dust, viruses,
                             and bacteria. Mucus is a slippery fluid that the membranes of the nose, mouth, throat, and vagina produce.

                        <p class="sub-paragraph">
							
                            When the mucus is penetrated by the virus, the virus then
                             enters a cell, the virus takes control 
                            and uses the cell’s machinery to manufacture more viruses, 
                            and these viruses then attack surrounding cells.

                    Most people with a common cold can be diagnosed by their signs and symptoms. 
                    If your doctor suspects you have a bacterial infection or other condition,
                     he or she may order a chest X-ray or other tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms.

                        To make yourself as comfortable as possible when you have a cold, try:


                    </p>
                    





                    
				<ul class="sub-list">
                    <li><strong>Drinking plenty of fluids.</strong>  Water, juice, 
                         clear broth or warm lemon water are good choices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol,
                        which can dehydrate you.</li>
                        
                            
                    <li><strong>Eating chicken soup. </strong> Chicken soup and other warm fluids can be
                                 soothing and can loosen congestion.</li>
      
                                
                <li><strong>Resting.</strong> If possible, stay home from work or school if you have a fever or a
                     bad cough or are drowsy after taking medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as
                    reduce the chances that you'll infect others.
                 </li>
      
                                    

                 <li><strong> Adjusting your room's temperature and humidity.</strong>
                    Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer
                     can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing.
                    Keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.</li>
      
                                        
                     <li><strong>  Soothing your throat. </strong>A saltwater gargle — 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt dissolved 
                         in a 4-ounce to 8-ounce glass of warm water — can temporarily relieve a sore or scratchy throat.</li>
                                        


                        <li><strong>Stress.</strong> Using saline nasal drops. To help relieve nasal congestion, try saline nasal drops.
                          You can buy these drops over-the-counter, and they can help relieve symptoms, even in children.</li>
                                            


                     
                 </ul>

                    In infants, gently suction the nostrils with a bulb syringe
                 (insert the bulb syringe about 1/4 to 1/2 inch, or about 6 to 12
                       millimeters) after applying saline drops.
