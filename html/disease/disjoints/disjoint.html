				<h4> Dislocation<hr></h4>
				<p class="main-paragraph">
                    A dislocation occurs when a bone slips out of a joint.
                     For example, the top of your arm bone fits into a joint
                      at your shoulder. When it slips or pops out of that joint,
                       you have a dislocated shoulder. You can dislocate 
                       almost any joint in your body, including your knee,
                        hip, ankle, or shoulder.
                    </p>

                        <p class="main-paragraph">
                            Since a dislocation means your bone is 
                            no longer where it should be, 
                            you should treat it as an emergency and seek 
                            medical attention as soon as possible. 
                            An untreated dislocation could cause damage to 
                            your ligaments, nerves, or blood vessels.

                    In most scenarios, you’ll easily be able to see a dislocation.
                     The area may be swollen or look bruised. You may notice that 
                     the area is red or discolored. 
                    It may also have a strange shape or be deformed

					What Causes a Dislocation?
				  
				</h2>
				<p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Dislocations typically result when a joint experiences
                     an unexpected or unbalanced impact. This might happen 
                     if you fall or experience a harsh hit to the affected area.
                     After a joint dislocates, it’s more likely
                      to dislocate again in the future..

                            How Is a Dislocation Treated?
						  
						</h2>
						<p class="sub-paragraph">
						
                            Your doctor’s choice of treatment will depend on which
                             joint you dislocated. It may also depend on the severity 
                             of your dislocation. According to Johns Hopkins University,
                              initial treatment for any dislocation involves RICE: Rest,
                               Ice, Compression, and Elevation
                            In some cases, the dislocated joint might go back into place
                             naturally after this treatment.                        </p>
                            
                             <p class="sub-paragraph">

                             If the joint doesn’t return to normal naturally,
                              your doctor may use one of the following treatments:
                            </p>

                                In this method, your doctor will manipulate or reposition 
                                the joint back into place. You’ll be given a sedative or anesthetic to 
                                 comfortable and also to allow the muscles near your joint to relax, 
                                 which eases the procedure.

                                After your joint returns to its proper place,
                                 your doctor may ask you to wear a sling, splint,
                                  or cast for several weeks. This will prevent the 
                                  joint from moving and allow the area to fully heal.
                                   The length of time your joint needs to be immobile will vary, 
                                depending on the joint and severity of the injury.

                                    your doctor may prescribe a pain reliever or

                                You will need surgery only if the dislocation
                                 damaged your nerves or blood vessels, or if your doctor
                                  is unable to return your bones to their normal position. 
                                  Surgery may also be necessary for those who often dislocate 
                                  the same joints, such as their shoulders. To prevent redislocation,
                                   it may be necessary to reconstruct the joint and repair any damaged structures.
                                 On occasion, a joint has to be replaced, such as a hip replacement.

                                    Rehabilitation begins after your doctor properly 
                                    repositions or manipulates the joint into the correct position and removes
                                     the sling or splint (if you needed one). You and your 
                                     doctor will devise a rehabilitation plan that works for you.
                                      The goal of rehabilitation is to gradually increase the joint’s
                                       strength and restore its range of motion. Remember, it’s important
                                        to go slowly so you don’t reinjure yourself before the recovery is complete.
