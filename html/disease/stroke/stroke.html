                    Stroke occurs due to a decrease or blockage in the brain’s blood supply.
                     A person experiencing a stroke needs immediate emergency treatment.

                        <p class="main-paragraph">
                            A stroke occurs when a blockage or bleed of the blood vessels either 
                            interrupts or reduces the supply of blood to the brain. When this happens,
                             the brain does not receive enough oxygen or nutrients,
                              and brain cells start to die.
                            </p>

                              Stroke is a cerebrovascular disease. This means that it 
                              affects the blood vessels that feed the brain oxygen.
                               If the brain does not receive enough oxygen, damage may start to occur.
                    </p>

                        death in the United States. In fact, nearly 800,000 people have a stroke each year.
                         That equates to around one person every 40 seconds.

    <p class="sub-paragraph">
        There are three main types of stroke:
        </p>

      
    

    <ul class="sub-list">

        <li><strong>Ischemic stroke: </strong> This is the most common type of stroke, 
            making up 87% of all cases. A blood clot prevents blood and oxygen from reaching
             an area of the brain.
        </li>
                            


        <li><strong>Hemorrhagic stroke: </strong>This occurs when a blood vessel ruptures.
             These are usually the result of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
                                </li>
                                


                                   
        <li><strong>Transient ischemic attack (TIA):</strong> This occurs when blood flow 
            to a part of the brain is inadequate for a brief period of time. Normal blood
             flow resumes after a short amount of time,
             and the symptoms resolve without treatment. Some people call this a ministroke.

        Stroke can be fatal. According to the American Heart Association (AHA),
         the age-adjusted mortality rate for 2017 was 37.6 in every 100,000
          stroke diagnoses. Doctors have made a great deal of progress in managing strokes, 
        meaning that this mortality rate is 13.6% lower than it was in 2007.

<!-- 
                    Diet
                    An unhealthy diet that increases your risk of stroke is one that’s high in:
                    
                    salt
                    saturated fats
                    trans fats
                    cholesterol
                    Inactivity
                    Inactivity, or lack of exercise, can also raise your risk for stroke.
                    
                    Regular exercise has a number of health benefits. The CDC recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hoursTrusted Source of aerobic exercise every week. This can mean simply a brisk walk a few times a week.
                    
                    Alcohol consumption
                    Your risk for stroke also increases if you drink too much alcohol. Alcohol consumption should be done in moderation. This means no more than one drink per day for women, and no more than two for men. More than that may raise blood pressure levels as well as triglyceride levels, which can cause atherosclerosis.
                    
                    Tobacco use
                    Using tobacco in any form also raises your risk for stroke, since it can damage your blood vessels and heart. This is further increased when smoking, because your blood pressure rises when you use nicotine.
                    
                    Personal background
                    There are certain personal risk factors for stroke that you can’t control. Stroke risk can be linked to your:
                    
                    Family history. Stroke risk is higher in some families because of genetic health issues, such as high blood pressure.
                    Sex. According to the CDCTrusted Source, while both women and men can have strokes, they’re more common in women than in men in all age groups.
                    Age. The older you are, the more likely you are to have a stroke.
                    Race and ethnicity. Caucasians, Asian Americans, and Hispanics are less likely to have a stroke than African-Americans, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.
                    Health history
                    Certain medical conditions are linked to stroke risk. These include:
                    
                    a previous stroke or TIA
                    high blood pressure
                    high cholesterol
                    heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease
                    heart valve defects
                    enlarged heart chambers and irregular heartbeats
                    sickle cell disease

                <div class="container">


                    <!-- Because ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes have different causes and effects on the body, both require different treatments.

Rapid diagnosis is important for reducing brain damage and enabling the doctor to treat the stroke using a suitable method for the type.

The sections below cover the treatment options for ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as some general rehabilitation tips for both types.

Ischemic stroke
Ischemic stroke occurs due to blocked or narrowed arteries. Treatment tends to focus on restoring an adequate flow of blood to the brain.

Treatment starts with taking drugs that break down clots and prevent others from forming. A doctor may administer blood thinners such as aspirin or an injection of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).

TPA is very effective at dissolving clots. However, the injection needs to take place within 4.5 hours of the stroke symptoms starting.

Emergency procedures include administering TPA directly into an artery in the brain or using a catheter to physically remove the clot. Research is ongoing as to the benefits of these procedures.

There are other procedures that surgeons can perform to reduce the risk of strokes or TIAs. A carotid endarterectomy, for example, involves opening the carotid artery and removing plaque that could break and travel to the brain.

Another option is angioplasty. This involves a surgeon inflating a small balloon inside a narrowed artery using a catheter. Afterward, they will insert a mesh tube, or a stent, into the opening. This prevents the artery from narrowing again.

Hemorrhagic stroke
Blood leaking into the brain can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. Treatment focuses on controlling the bleeding and reducing the pressure on the brain.

Treatment often begins with taking drugs that reduce pressure in the brain and control overall blood pressure, as well as preventing seizures and any sudden constrictions of blood vessels.

If a person is taking blood-thinning anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication, such as warfarin or clopidogrel, they can receive medications to counter the effects of the blood thinners.

Surgeons can repair some of the problems with blood vessels that have led or could lead to hemorrhagic strokes.

When an aneurysm — or a bulge in a blood vessel that may burst — causes a hemorrhagic stroke, a surgeon can place small clamps at the base of the aneurysm or fill it with detachable coils to stop the blood flow and shrink the aneurysm.

If the hemorrhage occurs due to an AVM, a surgeon can remove it. AVMs are connections between arteries and veins that can be at risk of bleeding.

Rehabilitation
Stroke is a potentially life changing event that can have lasting physical and emotional effects.

Successful recovery from a stroke will often involve specific therapies and support systems, including:

Speech therapy: This helps with problems producing or understanding speech. Practice, relaxation, and changing communication style can all make communicating easier.
Physical therapy: This can help a person relearn movement and coordination. It is important to stay active, even though this may be difficult at first.
Occupational therapy: This can help a person improve their ability to carry out daily activities, such as bathing, cooking, dressing, eating, reading, and writing.
Support groups: Joining a support group can help a person cope with common mental health issues that can occur after a stroke, such as depression. Many find it useful to share common experiences and exchange information.
Support from friends and family: Close friends and relatives should try to offer practical support and comfort after a stroke. Letting friends and family know what they can do to help is very important.
Rehabilitation is an important and ongoing part of stroke treatment. With the right assistance and the support of loved ones, regaining a normal quality of life is usually possible, depending on the severity of the stroke.

                            To start, your doctor will determine your cancer’s size, stage, and grade (how likely it is to grow and spread). After that, you can discuss your treatment options. Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Many women have additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or hormone therapy.

                                Several types of surgery may be used to remove breast cancer, including:</p>
                                
                            
                                <ul class="sub-list">
                                    <li><strong> Lumpectomy. </strong>This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Mastectomy.</strong> In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast.In a double mastectomy, both breasts are removed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Sentinel node biopsy.</strong> This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If they don’t have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Axillary lymph node dissection.</strong> If lymph nodes removed during a sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, your doctor may remove additional lymph nodes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. </strong>Even though breast cancer may be present in only one breast, some women elect to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer again.
                                    </li>                              
                                  
                        
                        
                                </ul>
                                










                                 
                            <h3 class="sub-heading-2" >Radiation therapy</h3>

                        
                            
                            <p class="sub-paragraph">
                           
                                 With radiation therapy, high-powered beams of radiation are used to target and kill cancer cells. Most radiation treatments use external beam radiation. This technique uses a large machine on the outside of the body.
                            </p>

                                Advances in cancer treatment have also enabled doctors to irradiate cancer from inside the body. This type of radiation treatment is called brachytherapy. To conduct brachytherapy, surgeons place radioactive seeds, or pellets, inside the body near the tumor site. The seeds stay there for a short period of time and work to destroy cancer cells.
                            </p>




                                
                               
                                 
                            <h3 class="sub-heading-2" >Chemotherapy</h3>

                        
                            
                            <p class="sub-paragraph">
                           
                                Chemotherapy is a drug treatment used to destroy cancer cells. Some people may undergo chemotherapy on its own, but this type of treatment is often used along with other treatments, especially surgery.
                            </p>
                             <p class="sub-paragraph">
                               
                                In some cases, doctors prefer to give patients chemotherapy before surgery. The hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not need to be as invasive. Chemotherapy has many unwanted side effects, so discuss your concerns with your doctor before starting treatment.
                            </p> 






                            
                                 
                            <h3 class="sub-heading-2" >  Hormone therapy</h3>

                        
                            
                            <p class="sub-paragraph">
                           
                              
                                If your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, your doctor may start you on hormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors. Hormone therapy works by blocking your body’s production of these hormones, or by blocking the hormone receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the growth of your cancer.
                            </p>




                            <h3 class="sub-heading-2" > Medications</h3>

                        
                            
                            <p class="sub-paragraph">

                        
                                 Certain treatments are designed to attack specific abnormalities or mutations within cancer cells. For example, Herceptin (trastuzumab) can block your body’s production of the HER2 protein. HER2 helps breast cancer cells grow, so taking a medication to slow the production of this protein may help slow cancer growth.

                     The best way to prevent a stroke is to address the underlying causes. People can achieve this by making lifestyle changes such as:

eating a healthful diet
maintaining a moderate weight
exercising regularly
not smoking tobacco
avoiding alcohol, or only drinking moderately
Eating a nutritious diet means including plenty of:

fruits
vegetables
whole grains
nuts
seeds
legumes
Be sure to limit the amount of red and processed meat in the diet, as well as cholesterol and saturated fats. Also, moderate salt intake to support healthy blood pressure levels.

Other measures a person can take to help reduce the risk of stroke include:

controlling their blood pressure levels
managing diabetes
getting treatment for heart disease
As well as making these lifestyle changes, taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications can also reduce the risk of experiencing another stroke.

Undergoing cardiac artery, carotid artery, or brain aneurysm surgery can also lower the risk of additional strokes, as can some other surgical options still under investigation.      -->

                            Breast cancer care
						  
						</h2>
						<p class="sub-paragraph">
						
							If you detect an unusual lump or spot in your breast, or have any other symptoms of breast cancer, make an appointment to see your doctor. Chances are good that it’s not breast cancer. For instance, there are many other potential causes for breast lumps.
                        </p>
                        <p class="sub-paragraph">
                            But if your problem does turn out to be cancer, keep in mind that early treatment is the key. Early-stage breast cancer can often be treated and cured if found quickly enough. The longer breast cancer is allowed to grow, the more difficult treatment becomes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="sub-paragraph">
                            If you’ve already received a breast cancer diagnosis, keep in mind that cancer treatments continue to improve, as do outcomes. So follow your treatment plan and try to stay positive. Find out more about the outlook for different stages of breast cancer.
