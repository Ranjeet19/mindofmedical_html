				<h4> Breast Cancer<hr></h4>
				<p class="main-paragraph">
                    Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women and 
                    the second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer.</p>

                    <p class="main-paragraph">Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in
                         genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply
                          in an uncontrolled way.

                        Breast cancer is cancer that develops in breast cells. 
                        Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast.
                         Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring 
                         the milk from the glands to the nipple. Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or
                          the fibrous connective tissue within your breast.
                        
                        </p>
                      

                        <p class="main-paragraph">
                        Like all forms of cancer, breast cancer is made of unusual cells that grow out of control. 
                        Those cells may also travel to 
                        places in your body where they aren’t usually found. When that happens, 
                        the cancer is called metastatic.
                        Different types of breast cancer grow and spread at different rates. 
                        Some take years to spread beyond your breast, while others grow and spread quickly.

					Who Gets Breast Cancer?
				  
				</h2>
				<p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Men can get breast cancer too, but they account for less than 1% of 
                    all breast cancer cases. Among women, breast cancer is the most second most common cancer diagnosed, 
                    after skin cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths, after lung cancer.
                    </p>

                      <p class="sub-paragraph">
                        On average, 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetimes.
                         About two-thirds of women with breast cancer are 55 or older. Most of 
                         the rest are between 35 and 54.

                        Fortunately, breast cancer is very treatable if you spot it early. 
                        Localized cancer (meaning it hasn’t spread outside your breast) can 
                        usually be treated before it spreads.
                        
                        Once the cancer begins to spread, treatment becomes more complicated. 
                        It can often control the disease for years.

					Diagnosis
				  
				</h2>
				<p class="sub-paragraph">To determine if your symptoms are caused by breast cancer or a benign breast condition, your doctor will do a thorough physical exam in addition to a breast exam. They may also request one or more diagnostic tests to help understand what’s causing your symptoms.

                    Tests that can help diagnose breast cancer include:
                    
                   
                    
                    </p>

                
				<ul class="sub-list">
					<li> Mammogram. The most common way to see below the surface of your breast is with an 
                        imaging test called a mammogram. Many women aged 40 and older get annual mammograms 
                        to check for breast cancer. If your doctor suspects you may have a tumor or suspicious spot, 
                        they will also request a mammogram.
                         If an abnormal area is seen on your mammogram, your doctor may request additional tests.</li>
					<li>Ultrasound. A breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues deep in your breast. An ultrasound can help your doctor distinguish between a solid mass, such as a tumor, and a benign cyst.
                    </li>
                    
                    
                    <li>MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combines different images of the breast to help a doctor identify cancer or other abnormalities. A doctor may recommend an MRI as a follow-up to a mammogram or ultrasound. Doctors sometimes use them as a screening tool for those at higher risk of breast cancer.

						Risk factors
					</h2>

					<p class="sub-paragraph">
								   
                        There are several risk factors that 
                        increase your chances of getting breast cancer.
                         However, having any of these doesn’t mean you will definitely develop the disease.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-paragraph">
                        Some risk factors can’t be avoided, such as family history. 
                        You can change other risk factors, such as smoking. Risk factors for breast cancer include:
                    </p>
                








					<ul class="sub-list">
						<li><strong>Age.</strong> Your risk for developing breast cancer increases as you age. Most invasive breast cancers are found in women over age 55.
                        </li>
                        
                            
                        <li><strong>  Drinking alcohol.</strong>  Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol raises your risk.</li>
      
                                
                        <li><strong>Having dense breast tissue.</strong> Dense breast tissue makes mammograms hard to read. It also increases your risk of breast cancer.
                                </li>
      
                                    

                        <li><strong> Gender.</strong>  White women are 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than white men, and black women are 70 times more likely to develop breast cancer than black men.
                                    </li>
      
                                        
                        <li><strong>Genes.</strong> Women who have the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are more likely to develop breast cancer than women who don’t. Other gene mutations may also affect your risk.
                                        </li>
                                        


                        <li><strong> Early menstruation. </strong>If you had your first period before age 12, you have an increased risk for breast cancer.
                        </li>
                                            


                        <li><strong>Giving birth at an older age. </strong>Women who don’t have their first child until after age 35 have an increased risk of breast cancer.
                                                </li>
                                                


                                                   
                        <li><strong>Hormone therapy.</strong> Women who took or are taking postmenopausal estrogen and progesterone medications to reduce their signs of menopause symptoms have a higher risk of breast cancer.
                             </li>
                                                    

                        <li><strong> Inherited risk.</strong> If a close female relative has had breast cancer, you have an increased risk for developing it. This includes your mother, grandmother, sister, or daughter. If you don’t have a family history of breast cancer, you can still develop breast cancer. In fact, the majority of women who develop it have no family history of the disease.
                            </li>
                                                       
                        
                        <li><strong>Late menopause start.</strong> Women who do not start menopause until after age 55 are more likely to develop breast cancer.

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Never being pregnant.</strong> Women who never became pregnant or never carried a pregnancy to full term are more likely to develop breast cancer.

                        </li>

                                In some cases, doctors prefer to give patients chemotherapy before surgery. The hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not need to be as invasive. Chemotherapy has many unwanted side effects, so discuss your concerns with your doctor before starting treatment.

                                If your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, your doctor may start you on hormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors. Hormone therapy works by blocking your body’s production of these hormones, or by blocking the hormone receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the growth of your cancer.

                                 Certain treatments are designed to attack specific abnormalities or mutations within cancer cells. For example, Herceptin (trastuzumab) can block your body’s production of the HER2 protein. HER2 helps breast cancer cells grow, so taking a medication to slow the production of this protein may help slow cancer growth.

							If you detect an unusual lump or spot in your breast, or have any other symptoms of breast cancer, make an appointment to see your doctor. Chances are good that it’s not breast cancer. For instance, there are many other potential causes for breast lumps.
                        </p>
                        <p class="sub-paragraph">
                            But if your problem does turn out to be cancer, keep in mind that early treatment is the key. Early-stage breast cancer can often be treated and cured if found quickly enough. The longer breast cancer is allowed to grow, the more difficult treatment becomes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="sub-paragraph">
                            If you’ve already received a breast cancer diagnosis, keep in mind that cancer treatments continue to improve, as do outcomes. So follow your treatment plan and try to stay positive. Find out more about the outlook for different stages of breast cancer.
