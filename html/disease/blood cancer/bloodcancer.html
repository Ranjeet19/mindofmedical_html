			<h4> Blood Cancer (Leukemia) <hr></h4>
				<p class="main-paragraph">
                    Blood cancer is also known as LEUKEMIA.<br>
                    Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow. Bone marrow produces blood cells. 
                    Leukemia can develop due to a problem with blood cell production. It usually affects the leukocytes,
                     or white blood cells (WCB).
                    <br>
                     Acute leukemia develops quickly and worsens rapidly, but chronic leukemia gets worse over time.
                      There are several different types of leukemia, and the best course of treatment 
                      and a person’s chance of survival depends on which type they have.

                     <p class="main-paragraph">
                     WBCs are a vital part of your immune system. They protect your body from invasion by bacteria, 
                     viruses, and fungi, as well as from abnormal cells and other foreign substances. In leukemia, 
                     the WBCs don’t function like normal WBCs. They can also divide too quickly and eventually 
                     crowd out normal cells.</p>

                     <p class="main-paragraph">
                     Leukemia is most likely to affect people over the age of 55 years,
                      but it is also the most common cancer in those aged under 15 years.

                    The National Cancer Institute estimates that 61,780 people will receive 
                     diagnosis of leukemia in 2019. 
                    They also predict that leukemia will cause 22,840 deaths in the same year.</p>

                Types of leukemia

            <p class="sub-paragraph">
            
                The onset of leukemia can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (slow onset).
                 In acute leukemia, cancer cells multiply quickly. In chronic leukemia,
                  the disease progresses slowly and early symptoms may be very mild.


                  Leukemia is also classified according to the type of cell.
                   Leukemia involving myeloid cells is called myelogenous leukemia.
                    Myeloid cells are immature blood cells that’d normally become granulocytes or monocytes.

                  Leukemia involving lymphocytes is called lymphocytic leukemia.
                   There are four main types of leukemia:


                <h3 class="sub-heading-2" >Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)</h3>

            
                
                <p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) can occur in children and adults.
                     According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program
                      of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), about 21,000 new cases of AML 
                      are diagnosed annually in the United States.
                     This is the most common form of leukemia. The five-year survival rate for AML is 26.9 percent.
                    </p>

                <p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) occurs mostly in children. The NCI 
                    estimates about 6,000 new cases of ALL are diagnosed annually.
                     The five-year survival rate for ALL is 68.2 percent.
                </p>

                        Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) affects mostly adults. 
                        About 9,000 new cases of CML are diagnosed annually, according to the NCI.
                         The five-year survival rate for CML is 66.9 percent.

                <p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is most likely to affect people over the age of 55.
                     It’s very rarely seen in children. According to the NCI, 
                     about 20,000 new cases of CLL are diagnosed annually. 
                     The five-year survival rate for CLL is 83.2 percent.

                    Hairy cell leukemia is a very rare subtype of CLL.
                     Its name comes from the appearance of the cancerous lymphocytes under a microscope.

				<h2 class="sub-heading">	Diagnosis</h2>
				<p class="sub-paragraph">
                    Leukemia may be suspected if you have certain risk factors or concerning symptoms.
                     Your doctor will begin with a complete history and physical examination,
                      but leukemia can’t be fully diagnosed by a physical exam. Instead, 
                      doctors will use blood tests, biopsies, and imaging tests to make a diagnosis.
                    </p>

                        There are a number of different tests that can be used to diagnose leukemia.
                         A complete blood count determines the numbers of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets in the blood.
                          Looking at your blood under a microscope can also determine if the cells have 
                          an abnormal appearance.
                        
                        Tissue biopsiescan be taken from the bone marrow or
                         lymph nodes to look for evidence of leukemia. 
                         These small samples can identify the type of leukemia and its growth rate. 
                         Biopsies of other organs such as the liver and spleen can show if the cancer has spread.

                Leukemia is usually treated by a hematologist-oncologist. 
                These are doctors who specialize in blood disorders and cancer.
                 The treatment depends on the type and stage of the cancer. 
                 Some forms of leukemia grow slowly and don’t need immediate treatment.
                 However, treatment for leukemia usually involves one or more of the following:
            </p>








            

            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li><strong>  Chemotherapy</strong>            uses drugs to kill leukemia cells.
                     Depending on the type of leukemia, you may take either a single drug or a 
                     combination of different drugs.
                </li>
                
                    
                    <li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong>  uses high-energy radiation to damage leukemia cells and inhibit their growth. Radiation can be applied to a specific area or to your entire body.
                    </li>

                        
                        <li><strong> Stem cell transplantation </strong>replaces diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow, either your own (called autologous transplantation) or from a donor (called allologous transplantation). This procedure is also called a bone marrow transplant.
                        </li>

                            

                            <li><strong> Biological or immune therapy </strong>uses treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.

                                <li><strong> Targeted therapy</strong>  uses medications that take advantage of vulnerabilities in cancer cells. For example, imatinib (Gleevec) is a targeted drug that’s commonly used against CML.
