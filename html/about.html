                    " MoM is generally stands for mind of medical,
                    With the aim of  “Be doctor of your BODY” 
                    which means little bit idea and knowledge 
                    about medical line which is essential for 
                    us in our life to maintain healthy life style 
                    and also there is lots of problem regarding disease 
                    and their treatment, symptoms,medicine and many more ..
                    So here we are to make it easier.
                    Generally we even don’t know about simple medicine name 
                    of any disease as well common diseases treatments too,
                     like if we got fever, we non-medical line peoples don’t
                      know what to do or what not to do for it,
                    What we can serve at this time, when to see doctors as 
                    well what is the solution.. so we are making such platforms
                     where you can learn about all of stuff that’s make comfortable 
                     during simple or common problems .."
