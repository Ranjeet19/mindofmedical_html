                   Paracetamol is a common painkiller used to treat aches and pain.
            It can also be used to reduce a high temperature.
            Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen and APAP, is a medication used to treat pain and fever.
             It is typically used for mild to moderate pain relief.
            Evidence is mixed for its use to relieve fever in children.
            It is often sold in combination with other medications, such as in many cold medications.
            Paracetamol is also used for severe pain, such as cancer pain and pain after surgery,
             in combination with opioid pain medication. It is typically used either by mouth or rectally,
              but is also available by injection into a vein. Effects last between two and four hours.
